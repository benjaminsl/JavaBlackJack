This is a command line blackjack game.

To play the game, cd into the project directory and run the command "make".

The files Card.java, Deck.java, Hand.java, and BlackjackHand.java were mostly 
written by the Department of Math and CS at Hobart and William Smith Colleges.
I have made a few revisions to some of these files.

The file PlayBlackJack was written by me.

The original Card.java, Deck.java, Hand.java, and BlackjackHand.java
